# NutriClass: Food Classification Using Nutritional Data

## 📌 Overview
NutriClass is a **GUVI Mini Project** that demonstrates an end-to-end **Machine Learning pipeline** using food nutrition data.  
The project covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, unsupervised learning, supervised classification, model evaluation, and inference.

The project is **exam-ready, portfolio-ready**.

## 🧠 Skills Takeaway
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Feature engineering for tabular data  
- Handling numerical, categorical, and boolean features  
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA  
- Unsupervised learning (KMeans, DBSCAN)  
- Supervised classification modeling  
- Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)  
- Model evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)  
- Machine learning inference  
- Visualization using Power BI and Streamlit  

---

## 🧭 ML Approach
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Used to explore natural groupings in food nutrition data  
- **Supervised Learning**: Used to classify food as *Healthy* or *Unhealthy* using rule-based labels  

This mirrors real-world ML workflows where exploration precedes prediction.
